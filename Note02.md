# How do you pay for AWS

AWS offers pay-to-price pricing for over 200 cloud services for the purpose of paying for services only
where you can use it without contracts or licenses you can use the cloud without any problem since you can
cancel it at no additional cost.

Pay for what you use: In AWS you only pay for the service that you use, since the payment prices allow you to help your organization have
more agility and meet the demands of scale with the sole purpose of improving the capabilities of the company,
reducing the risks or lack of capacity, thus taking into account the innovation, invention allowing the business to be more elastic.


Pay less when you reserve: you can get discounts as use increases, which prices for the service are differentiated as (Amazon S3, Amazon EBS,
or Amazon EFS of the service where it details that the more you use the service you will pay less per GB and
because data transfer is free.

pay less when you use more and as aws grows: focuses on the low costs of doing business which results

# AWS modelos de pago: Key Principles 

Three fundamental drivers of cost 

- Compute: Charged per hour/ Second
           Varies by instance type

- Storage : Changed typically per GB

- Data Transfer: Outbound is aggregated and charged
                 Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions)
                 Charged typically per GB

  # AWS offers several pricing models depending on product

   - which reservations include (Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances, Amazon DynamoDB Reserved Capacity,

one of the quotes that I found interesting in the video was the main keys since it explains in detail the fundamental prices that it contains
such as database data, transfer, license, GB to verify that the more data you transfer, the less you pay per GB and everything that this contains
for the cost thus giving the flexibility to acquire the service without any additional cost. we also have AWS Free Tier: Services where it explains
free services that have no cost and you can purchase it to develop your projects or whatever you wantto store the information, 
one of the services are ( Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, Consolidated Billing among other services).However, the components of IT Infrastructure and Types of IT infrastructure are always present.

In this module I learned about how to use aws and the benefits that it contains since for each piece of information there are different services
that you can use to develop with more ease, flexibility your projects or any other information
that you want to develop.
